# Experiments

1. Performance of `@contextmanager` vs decorators for injecting new
   properties into an object.
   Verdict: decorators are about 5x faster.
   file: `decorator_vs_context_manager.py`

# Other files
1. `tictoc.py` implements timing functions for timing executions.

# Note
Experiments may not be the most minimal since I'm only testing specific
things that I need.
